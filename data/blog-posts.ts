This man turned out to be Krishnamurthy, a retired chef who had spent decades perfecting the art of making soft, fluffy idlis. Fascinated by Krishnamurthy's stories and passion for food, Raman ended up spending his entire stay in Mysore learning the intricacies of South Indian cooking from the master chef.",

The positive feedback was overwhelming, with many suggesting he should consider turning his passion into a profession. In 1997, taking a leap of faith, Raman quit his secure banking job and invested his savings in a small food stall near Jayanagar.

Gradually, a loyal customer base developed, with people willing to queue for up to 30 minutes just to taste Raman's creations.

For younger children, simplify by reducing the number of variables. Another engaging option is 'Knights and Knaves,' where some characters always tell the truth while others always lie, and players must determine who's who based on their statements. These puzzles can be solved individually or as a group effort, with family members sharing their reasoning and building on each other's insights.",

            "Mathematical brain teasers develop numerical reasoning and pattern recognition without feeling like homework. The '100 Game' challenges players to take turns adding numbers from 1-10 to reach exactly 100. 'Magic Squares' require arranging numbers in a grid so each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same sum. For a physical challenge, try the 'Tangram' puzzle, where seven geometric pieces must be arranged to form specific shapes. These activities build mathematical confidence in a low-pressure environment and show children how math extends beyond textbook problems. Adjust difficulty by changing constraints or introducing time limits for older participants.",

Classic word games like 'Word Association Chains' (where each new word must relate to the previous one) or 'Categories' (naming items in a category with each successive letter of the alphabet) require no materials and can be played anywhere. For more structured challenges, try creating anagrams, solving riddles, or playing 'Word Squares' where words read the same horizontally and vertically. These activities are particularly valuable for multilingual families, as they can be adapted to different languages to support language learning and appreciation of linguistic diversity.",

      conclusion:
        "Incorporating weekly brain teasers into your family routine offers benefits that extend far beyond the immediate fun of solving puzzles. These activities foster a growth mindset by normalizing the process of working through challenges, making mistakes, and persisting until a solution is found. They create opportunities for different family members to shine, as various puzzles call on different strengths and thinking styles. Perhaps most importantly, they establish intellectual curiosity and critical thinking as valued family traits. Start with puzzles that match your family's current interests and abilities, then gradually introduce new types of challenges to expand everyone's cognitive horizons. The thinking skills developed through these enjoyable activities will serve family members well in academic, professional, and personal contexts throughout their lives.",

During the Ideation Phase (Weeks 4-6), teams brainstorm potential solutions, evaluate their feasibility, and select their most promising concept to develop further. The Prototyping Phase (Weeks 7-9) involves creating a working model or detailed plan of their solution, testing it, and refining based on feedback. Finally, in the Presentation Phase (Weeks 10-12), teams prepare comprehensive documentation and a compelling presentation of their project for the judging panel. This phased approach ensures that students develop a thorough understanding of both the problem and their proposed solution.",
